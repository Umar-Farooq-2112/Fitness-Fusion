# Fitness-Fusion
 Our product is a mobile application linked to a database. It is a fitness application that takes the user’s weight and height as input and assigns an exercise and diet plan for them to follow in accordance with their calculated BMI and chosen keywords. These plans are devised by experienced trainers verified and authorized by the administrator. Therefore, there are three separate interfaces for the administrator, trainer and trainee and each is provided with a special set of privileges. The end user’s personal information such as name and email address are taken as input before advancing to the Home Screen. Here, the trainee has the authority to view his/her assigned exercise and diet plans as well as browse through the exercise and food catalogue in addition to profile screen functionalities such as change name, password, calculate BMI, and submit feedback. The trainers have a special functionality in their interface which allows them to create said exercise and diet plans. The admin, on the other hand, has the responsibility of managing the food and exercise catalogues and accepting or rejecting trainer requests as well as viewing feedback.
